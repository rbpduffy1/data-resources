    "Finally, we'll use inferential statistics to make generlizations about our data samples to the larger population. The first step in this process is to define the hypotheses that we want to test. Let's formulate a null and an alternative hypothesis for the question from our brief.\n",
    "\n",
    "**H<sub>null</sub>**: The average user ratings of Apple and Google users are equal (e.g., there is no difference between the two). If there is a difference, then it is due to random chance.\n",

    "**Confidence level**: 0.95\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the hypotheses and significance levels are defined, we are going to try to reject or accept the null hypothesis by using statistical tests. We'll start with the [Student's t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test#Independent_two-sample_t-test), which is derived from the t-distribution, to evaluate differences between two independent groups. For our brief, we'll conduct a Student's t-test using the `stats.ttest_ind` function to compare the differences between Apple and Google user ratings."

    "The results from our Student's t-test - specifically, the very small p-value - suggest that we can reject the null hypothesis that there are not significant differences between Apple and Google users and their app ratings. However, there are a number of assumptions that are built into the Student's t-test (you can read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test#Independent_two-sample_t-test)). This test assumes that the variances between groups are equal. As we discovered while exploring our descriptive statistics, this isn't the case. To get around this assumption, we can use a Welch’s t-test from the `stats.ttest` function we used above, which doesn't make this assumption if we set the parameter `equal_var` to `False`."

We know from our histograms that the data _looks normal_ -- i.e. it has one peak, and it seems symmetrical about that peak.

We can use the `normaltest()` function from the `stats` sub-library to do this.\n",

    "We've run through a number of statistical tools to better understand our data and answer the question posed at the beginning of this workshop: Did Apple Store apps receive different average user ratings than Google Play apps by users? The calculation of our group means indicates this is the case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis of the descriptive statistics suggest that Google's ratings were, on average, a bit better than Apple's. After running two statistical tests -- Student's t-test and Welch's t-test -- we rejected the null hypothesis, which stated that the average user ratings between the two groups are different from one another. \n",

    "Perhaps we have more than two groups whose differences in mean user ratings we want to examine. For example, the Amazon Appstore is an alternative to the Google and Apple platforms and provides apps for users of Androids. To investigate whether there are significant differences between the mean user ratings of all three groups, we can use a process called [_Analysis of Variance_](https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/one-way-anova-statistical-guide.php) (or ANOVA). \n",
    "\n",

    "H<sub>null</sub>:The mean user rating is the same among all three platforms.\n",

    "H<sub>alternative</sub>: The mean user rating is _not_ the same among all three platforms. \n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA is a method that allows us to test these hypotheses. The basic idea is to break up the variation of our data into two groups - _between_  and _within_ - to see if there are group differences. If the between group variation is larger than the within group variation, the means of our groups will not be equal. If the between and within group variations are approximately the same size, then we should expect there to be no significant differences between our groups means. ANOVA assumes normality, independent random samples, and homogeneity of variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate whether there are statistically significant differences among the three groups, we can compute an F statistic derived from the F distribution using the ratio of the between and within group variance (for more on the F statistic, see [this](https://statisticsbyjim.com/anova/f-tests-anova/)). As the F statistics gets larger, so too does the chance of rejecting the null hypothesis. Similar to t-tests, the p-value associated with the F statistic helps us determine if we can reject the null hypothesis. For example, if our significance level is 95% and our p-value for our F statistic is <= .05 when we use an ANOVA, we can say that the mean user ratings for the Google, Apple, and Amazon app stores are statistically not all equal for these three groups. \n",
